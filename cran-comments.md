## R CMD check test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R version 3.3.0 (2016-05-03)
* on travis-ci: ubuntu (R:release and R:devel)
* on travis-ci: osx (R:release and R:devel)
* on win-builder: (R-devel and R-release)

## R CMD check test results on all environments but win-builder
R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## R CMD check test results on win-builder
R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  API (4:14, 10:10, 14:33, 14:53)
  
Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), we believe this spelling to be correct.

R CMD check tests were run in all test environments listed at the top of this note.

Thank you for your help.
